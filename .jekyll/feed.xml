				<title>Just Keep Swimming</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Benefits-of-Swimming.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive centreThis img-rounded&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll admit, my mind no longer works the same way as it used to work 4 years ago. I have now a lot to do, lot to think and lot to plan. Things have not been easy but every step has shaped me into someone I would not want to mess with if I had met him 5 years ago. My problem has always been putting others in front of me, thankfully now that i have recognized it I no longer fear outcomes, I feel like a doer. The mantra I follow is to &amp;#8220;just keep swimming&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life has the habit of beating you down, the more you expect the more you get hurt. So instead of expecting things just &amp;#8220;do&amp;#8221; and move on. If its supposed to work its gonna happen otherwise it was worth a try. All I am trying to say is that don&amp;#8217;t let anything stop you from doing what you have always wanted to do. There can be hurdles but you can always cross them. Your life might become difficult for some time, but the rest of it will be spent in the joy of knowing you lived it the way you always wanted to. Rock On!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>GBG Peshawar</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;So I attended an event organized by &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GBG&lt;/span&gt; Islamabad and The Digital League. It was the first ever event to be organized for women enterpreneurs here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MariaUmar&quot;&gt;Maria Umar&lt;/a&gt; and Premier Formica Industries. The event got kicked off by a presentation on Google Adwords by Saad Hameed. He explained using Adwords to your advantage for higher rate of conversions. Saad also gave examples of creating good Ads and how to specifically target your Ads towards select users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second session was about How to stay safe online. The presentation was given by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/UsamaKhilji&quot;&gt;Usama Khilji&lt;/a&gt; who explained it all pretty well to changes passwords periodocially&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know this all sounds boring. Ha! I got you all didn&amp;#8217;t I? I was trying to doze you all to sleep. Well actually the event was pretty nice. It was really cool to see some enterepreneurs from KP show up. I met Haris N. another celebrity in the Pakistani tech. scene the founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.androidpakistan.com&quot;&gt;Android Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; . It was a wonderful experience meeting all these amazing people many of whom are the next generation of enterpreneurs. Now I feel much more confident following the path I have chosen(More on that in another post). The tech. industry of Pakistan is setting its eyes upon KP and it means good things are about to happen. &lt;strong&gt;Fingers Crossed!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Helios</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/helios-img.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have been working on one of the client apps enabling it to support push notifications. The huge question was what should I use as a suitable backend to serve as my &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;APN&lt;/span&gt; Provider? After a lot of digging I settled for apn_on_rails a great gem, has been around from a long time and it seems a lot of people are using it. However, after stumbling upon &lt;a href=&quot;http://helios.io&quot;&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt; I completely changed my mind. Helios is a wonderful little framework written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mattt&quot;&gt;Matt Thompson&lt;/a&gt; which provides out of the box push notification, passbook, in-app purchase and remote data synchronization. This means that the developer&amp;#8217;s job got a whole lot less as most of the heavy-lifting backend technology is already crafted into this wonderful little solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would totally advise to anyone struggling with Backends for their iOS Apps to give Helios a try. It can very easily be integrated with a Rack/Sinatra or Rails app. The few things to keep in mind is to install the edge version of the gem. A very special thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gregplumbly&quot;&gt;Greg&lt;/a&gt; for pointing this out. I struggled a lot with this issue at first. The push message feature of the current gem is broken so in your Gemfile specify the Helios gem like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;helios&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;https://github.com/helios-framework/helios.git&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To send push messages you currently have to do a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt; to /message of whatever your url is. I am pretty sure a built in compose section is on its way too(why not submit a pull request?). Anyways if you encounter any problems do checkout the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/helios-framework/helios&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; , go through the ReadMe its very easy to setup and use. Helios is created from many other opensource components like RackPushNotfication and Houston. It not only solves the issue of device registration and maintanenace via the Orbiter library but also provides backend to have your Apps Data(Core Data Models) Synchronize remotely. I think we iOS+Ruby Devs should focus more on collabarating on this project and make it a stable solution rather than creating our own &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;APN&lt;/span&gt; Providers as it seems very promising and focuses on the issues we all suffer the most. Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Getting Started with Backbone js</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/backbone-logo.PNG&quot; class=&quot;centreThis img-responsive img-rounded&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;When I first heard the term client-side &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MVC&lt;/span&gt; I got a vague picture of some sharply written framework in javascript whose job will be to improve the user experience. Being a dev who has been working with &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MVC&lt;/span&gt; frameworks from quite some time(Rails, Cocoa and Asp) I failed to imagine and apply the advantages of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MVC&lt;/span&gt; based approach on the client side. It was not until one fine summer afternoon when I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.backbonejs.org&quot;&gt;Backbone.js&lt;/a&gt; on Github, I was finally able to comprehend the level of awesomeness client side &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MVC&lt;/span&gt; offered. I was working on a project called &lt;a href=&quot;http://kronos.appointmentor.com&quot;&gt;Kronos&lt;/a&gt; which relied heavily on javascript and needless to say all the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DOM&lt;/span&gt; code for jQuery quickly became spaghetti and difficult to maintain. That&amp;#8217;s when I finally realized the main objective of client side &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MVC&lt;/span&gt; or MV* frameworks, to keep your code maintainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now allow me to elaborate this a little from my experience. If you are the kind of developer who just writes a few lines of javascript code(possible jQuery) to animate a box or fetch a json Feed, an MV* framework is not for you. If you are however a javascript ninja and have to write hundreds of lines of code, to perform &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CRUD&lt;/span&gt;, provide a neat UX and/or keep your code readable, go with a MV* framework like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.backbonejs.org&quot;&gt;Backbone.js&lt;/a&gt; and be a happy camper for the rest of your dev life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backbone.js like ever other MV* or &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MVC&lt;/span&gt; framework is based on the simple principle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seperation of Concerns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Backbone.js&amp;#8217; case the main components are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name implies, models here are the data and all the operations like validations, computations etc. we apply on them. In backbone.js a model is defined like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;    
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Backbone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;extend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;initialize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to this world&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;person&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Views&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now notice that I have been calling backbone.js a MV* framework rather than a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MVC&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MVVM&lt;/span&gt; framework, thats because there are no controllers or ViewModels here. Your controller logic if any, lives inside a View in backbone.js so you view is bascially a ViewController.Views are how the data is presented in your app. You are allowed to take advantage of javascript templating libraries like &lt;a href=&quot;http://emberjs.com/&quot;&gt;Ember.js&lt;/a&gt; . This is how a view is defined in backbone.js:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SearchView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Backbone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;extend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;initialize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Alerts suck.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// The initialize function is always called when instantiating a Backbone View.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Consider it the constructor of the class.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;search_view&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SearchView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Routers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last piece of the puzzle. The Router&amp;#8217;s job is to understand and provide the urls necessary for your client side code to work in conjuction with the server side. Althought not necessary to implement, but if your app uses url routing etc they make the job easier. This is how on defines a router:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AppRouter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Backbone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;extend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;routes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;*actions&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;defaultRoute&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// matches http://example.com/#anything-here&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Initiate the router&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app_router&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AppRouter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app_router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;route:defaultRoute&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;actions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;actions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Start Backbone history a necessary step for bookmarkable URL&amp;#39;s&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Backbone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;history&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some resources I found useful in getting started with backbone.js:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope those of you who are starting with client side &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MVC&lt;/span&gt;/MV* or are already working on it find this post useful. This is all for now. Rock on!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Plan9</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/plan9balloon.PNG&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Yes I know this post has been long overdue since I came back from the event last week. As most of you know Plan9 is a platform for young entrepreneurs(like moi) to present and get help turn their ideas into a reality. Its a pretty sweet deal once your get shortlisted; they give you an office at Arfa Software Technology Park, Mentorship, Rs. 20K monthly stripend to each member of your team and six months to complete the project. Seriously its worth it, too bad you are gonna wait till the next time its announced as all deadlines have ended. More information on their &lt;a href=&quot;http://plan9.pitb.gov.pk/&quot;&gt;website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received an email on Friday after prayers that we had been selected to attend Plan9 Islamabad to pitch our idea so on a very short notice me and my buddies arranged accomodation/travel as the event was to take place tomorrow i.e. Saturday. Once we reached our Hotel we had dinner and prepared our pitch. We brought our best idea and we knew it was too good to say no to. It was a game we had been working on from quite some time now(more on that later) but again this post is not about the idea its about the experience. So where was I? Oh yes we had a good night sleep and went to Comsats islamabad the next day for initial pitches. The event started a bit late(the story of Pakistan, the participants showed up late). Anyhow the first batch of pitches started, we were told that some 200 people had applied and only 30 made it here. That boosted our confidence to a ninja level. Then came the time to present the idea in front of the judges. Yeah the judges, what we did not know that the pioneer of the gaming industry in Pakistan Mr. &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/sheryhydri&quot;&gt;Shehryar Hydri&lt;/a&gt; will be presiding there. We were already starting to lose some sweat but as soon as we gave our first pitch I had a hunch that guys no matter what happens we are clearing the first shortlisting round today, my partner&amp;#8217;s however had mixed opinions. Anyways we did get shortlisted among four others from the total of thirty applicants(I was right). Then started the mentoring session which was the real eye-opener for me. We spent some good two hours talking to different mentors who were there for us and we refined our idea with the help of Shery Bhai, Mr. Syed and other mentors. What we really enjoyed was the mentoring session by Shery Bhai who like an elder experienced brother made us realize that we brought the wrong idea to the table here. We quickly realized that we might not make it any further which made us learn the first lesson:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t bring an AK47 to a Knife fight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/from-plan9/mateen-usman.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;So this was the end of the first day, at the end of which I suffered from the worst headache ever, took two pills of aspirin and it was good night Pakistan for me. Then comes in the final pitch day a.k.a the reckoning. We woke up pretty early and started working on the presentation in the hotel. Once done we made our way to the university and got some final mentoring from Shery Bhai. Deep in our hearts we knew this was the end of it, we are not going to make it any further and probably never end up sitting in Arfa Software Technology park but we went along with it anyway. We gave our final pitch, tried the best we could. At one point we were asked could we name one female who takes care of her home and will play the game we are building and all of a sudden the first woman who came in my mind was The awesome &lt;a href=&quot;http://pakimom.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;Miss Maria Umar&lt;/a&gt; founder of the Woman&amp;#8217;s Digital League which brings us to lesson number two:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t ever speak Miss Maria&amp;#8217;s name in front of a whole panel of judges, she is just too awesome and does not have time to give your game a try.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving along we had to wait for like 10 mins for the results to get compiled and as predicted we did not get the incubation. Surprisingly four out of the five finalists made it except for us, in other words we were the only ones who were not in the winner&amp;#8217;s photograph with the judges (&lt;strong&gt;sigh&lt;/strong&gt;). At first it stung a little, coming so close to winning and being the only one&amp;#8217;s going back empty handed but after a few minutes the moment passed away and I could see the big picture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/from-plan9/ali.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; No, stahp! Thats not the big picture(me) I was talking about(but I do look awesome in it don&amp;#8217;t I?). What I meant was living and working in a place like Peshawar where hardly anyone ever believes you are doing some real work unless you are a doctor or an engineer, Plan9 broadened our vision. Our idea could not take flight here but we did not go back empty handed. We took with ourselves a great deal of motivation, encouragement and most importantly the pathway we need to follow. Our idea was a game like farmville but we learnt that we need to first launch a game like tic-tac-toe and pass through all the process to be ready to take on something as big as this. So here&amp;#8217;s to  P@sha, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PITB&lt;/span&gt; and all other&amp;#8217;s involved in giving us youngsters a platform like Plan9. We could not launch our balloon here but its ok, we know that there is still hope and we need to sharpen our saw first. Thank you :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/picard-facepalm.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;I have observed that people are most afraid of failure or having to relive their life&amp;#8217;s most embarrassing moments again. This is not a motivational post to tell you its all going to be fine, in fact this is a list of epic fails from my own life to tell you that it&amp;#8217;s ok to fail. Its all a part of your life and the most valuable lessons you learn are from failures/embarrassing moments. &lt;!--break--&gt; So here&amp;#8217;s my list of Epic Fails, enjoy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Got Punched by a girl&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failometer Level:&lt;/strong&gt; 3/10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the oldest epic fail I can remember. There was this girl, I dont remember her name, she was a bully(I did not know it either). She was playing with sand(used to be a hit back then). So me being a curious person I am, asked her nicely what was she building only to be punched in the face(she had a wicked arm I tell you). I completely blacked out, cried in a corner, was too afraid to tell the teacher and had a swollen lip. Girl! I hope wherever you are, Karma got the best of you and your marriage is in shambles and you quitely cry yourself to sleep thinking about the little boy you punched. Screw You!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lesson Learnt:&lt;/em&gt; If somebody is mean to you, kick their ass&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Was a Carrot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failometer Level:&lt;/strong&gt; Carrot/10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/220px-CarrotRoots.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;This is another one from school. I was among the really tall kids in my class and there was moment when I was the tallest. Annual day was coming and teacher tells us we are going to be playing vegetables. Everybody is super excited offcourse, except me. Why? The teacher tells me, as I am very tall I get to be a carrot. I could see it coming but went along with it anyway. So I played the role of a carrot, and had to live by the nickname of Gajar(Carrot in Urdu) for like a very long time. I have the video of it somewhere on &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;VHS&lt;/span&gt;, if anybody has the equipment to convert it to digital format please let me know so that I may once again live the embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lesson Learnt:&lt;/em&gt; Dont be a Carrot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Got Stitches for trying to act Cool&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failometer Level:&lt;/strong&gt; 6.5/10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one from my school days(Yeah I know). This one was made to look like an accident for the sake of two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Not to get busted for breaking a glass pane in the door.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Not to look like an idiot who just tried to pull off a stunt to look cool and got a bloody arm as a result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/stitches.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;The story is that I was performing whudu(abulation) in the wash room and all of a sudden this troll friend of mine appears and locks the door behind me. Now I act cool(panic mode: on) and decide to break one the glass panes in the door to open the lock. With all my force I punched the glass pane, hear the triumphant sound of it shattering and open the door. As soon as I come out, I get a feeling something is not right. I look at my hand to find it bleeding like &amp;#8220;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;OMG&lt;/span&gt;!!! Its time to panic, quick scream like a little girl and embarrass yourself&amp;#8221;. I made up a story that I slipped when somebody was opening the door from the other side and my hand went throught the glass pane. Why am I telling the truth now? because screw the school, it does not even exist anymore(They sold it off to make a buck load of money). I got five stitches(the bad part) and a couple of days off(the good part).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lesson Learnt:&lt;/em&gt; Dont Panic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New Shirt, Forgot to take Price Tag &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;OFF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failometer Level:&lt;/strong&gt; 2/10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is from the glorious days of university. I was the newly appointed President of the Computer Cell(a Team of Awesome People like me who loved to code and had a problem with almost everything) and as my first order or business I called a meeting to throw away ideas. Throughout the meeting my fellow people kept on smiling and giggling while elbowing each other. I knew something was wrong, at first I thought my fly was open(Thank God it was not). After the meeting I was told by a friend that I have a price tag on my shirt, which shows it was recently bought. I could not think of anything to say at that moment and spent the rest of the day staring blankly out of the cafeteria window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lesson Learnt:&lt;/em&gt; Pay attention to your wardrobe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Made the jump of the century, sprained my ankle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failometer Level:&lt;/strong&gt; 7/10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Ankle_en.svg/230px-Ankle_en.svg.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;This epic fail happened when I was gone for my &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ISSB&lt;/span&gt; Examination. For those of you who do not know, its an exam you have to appear for in order to get selected in the Armed Forces of Pakistan. Its an intensive test of physical and mental endurannce in which they interview you, ask embarrassing questions, make you run through an obstacle course and force you to go to sleep before 11 pm. No, I did not die and Yes I did not get selected, instead I earned the worst ever sprain my ankle has ever felt. I had to jump off a platform, climb on another that was 5 feet high and finally jump on the ground to land safely on some sand. I make the most awesome jump ever(&lt;strong&gt;insert dramatic music&lt;/strong&gt;) and instead of landing on the sand I landed feet first on solid ground. As a result I got a sprained ankle and had difficulty walking for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lesson Learnt:&lt;/em&gt; Look before you leap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Forgot the lyrics of a song I was singing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failometer Level:&lt;/strong&gt; Don&amp;#8217;t Ask/10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the most epic fail ever and I have video proof of it. I was taking part in a competition at my university and had to sing a song. So I chose a song I really like and went along singning it. It was going very well(as you can observe by the applause) when my scumbag brain decided to forget the lyrics in between and make me choke. Thankfully the audience helped me remember and I continued to sing but I am never going to forget this epic fail, ever! Here is the video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://www.twitvid.com/embed.php?guid=AZA7S&amp;autoplay=0&quot; title=&quot;Twitvid video player &quot; class=&quot;twitvid-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final Words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your epic fails are awesome(so are you!) and when you recall them you realize what a fun life you&amp;#8217;ve had. I am not ashamed of these moments(Duh! I just wrote about them) for they have shaped me into a better and stronger person. So don&amp;#8217;t be embarrassed to remember and laugh out loud on your epic fails Feel free to share them in the comments if you would like. Hope you enjoyed this post my dear readers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Couponific</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I have been working with MVC3 for over two months now and I needed a distraction. I have noticed that I get bored with one technology stack when I reach some considerable level of experience on it and that is exactly what I am feeling towards .net these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this weekend out of boredom I decided to create something in rails, just for fun and some learning experience. I came up with this little web app that creates and sends Digital Coupons. Its a pretty basic actionmailer based app but I plan to add some more features over the coming weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its a fun way to tell your friends, you care or give them a free pass on something. Give it shot: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.couponificapp.com&quot;&gt;Couponific&lt;/a&gt; Let me know what you think. Rock On!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Drop Down List XML hack in MVC</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Today I ran into a situation where I had to populate a drop down list inside a razor view with some data. I did not want to get the data from the database, I wanted a simpler approach so I decided to use an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; file to populate my dropdown list. Here&amp;#8217;s how I did it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I created an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot; encoding=&amp;quot;utf-8&amp;quot; ?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Countries&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Country&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Pakistan&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;value=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;PK&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/Country&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Country&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;America&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;value=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;USA&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/Country&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Country&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;England&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;value=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;UK&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/Country&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/Countries&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then after doing a barrell roll, I proceeded to write some code inside my controller to take the data from this &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; file and put it inside the magical ViewBag:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;~/Countries.xml&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;XDocument&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;xdoc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;XDocument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MapPath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IEnumerable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;XElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;xdoc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Elements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Countries&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Elements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Country&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                                           &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;listItems&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SelectListItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;foreach&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;xElement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;listItems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SelectListItem&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;xElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;xElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;value&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SelectList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;selectList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SelectList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;listItems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Value&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Text&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ViewBag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;countries&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;selectList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pretty simple stuff I am just loading the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; file inside a XDocument, using Linq to traverse and create an IEnumerable to hold all the countries in. Aftewards I create a SelecList(So that I can use the data inside a DropDownList) and pass it on to the super awesome dynamic ViewBag. The last piece of the puzzle is offcourse the razor view where I show this data from the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; file inside a dd, here is how that is implemented:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;@Html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DropDownListFor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Country&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IEnumerable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SelectListItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ViewBag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;countries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thats it, a super simple quick hack to populate your dropdowns. Rock On!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Whats new in MVC4</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been a couple of days that I am playing with MVC4 in my free time. I installed Visual Studio 11 Beta for the Web as soon as it came out, but never really got the chance to check it out properly. We had a power outage today for like 7 hours which and I had no Internets(yes I like to call it Internets, its not a Typo) which gave me time to check out MVC4 and I have one word for it, Cheese Omellete. Ok thats two words but thats how MVC4 made me feel, a healthy and delicious breakfast recipe. So here is a little breakdown of the new features of MVC4:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ASP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NET&lt;/span&gt; Web &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds cool doesn&amp;#8217;t it. A framework that can create &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; Services that work on any client, be it mobile or web browser. It also makes it dead simple to write &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;REST&lt;/span&gt; Service. Do give this one a try, you will be making web services better than you grandpa ever could. Some of it&amp;#8217;s features are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Modern &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; Programming Model.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Full Support for Routes(Yes works pretty much like Rails now).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Content Negotiation(This is smart, the client and server are now able to determine the data type being returned. You can also add your own formats.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Self Host(You can host a  Web &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; inside your own process or &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IIS&lt;/span&gt; and can still use routes etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asp.net/web-api&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ASP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NET&lt;/span&gt; Web &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Single Page Applications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is my favourite. You can now create a Single Page Application with rich client functionality using the built-in scaffoldings. You single page application will have a very small footprint yet having all you need. Need a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DAL&lt;/span&gt;? No Problemo! Thats supported too. Click &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asp.net/single-page-application&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more information on single page applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Enhanced Default Project Templates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks like MS finally understands that nobody likes the default project template that comes with MVC3 and Web Forms. So they have shashkafied the default project template(See images below). It not only looks better, it&amp;#8217;s responsive too. Yes! Out of the box Responsiveness. Progressive Enhancement Extraordinare MS! Bravo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i1.asp.net/common/www-css/i/mvc4/image001.png&quot; class=&quot;centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Mobile Project Template&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now create web apps for mobile using builtin templates too. The Views are based on jQuery Mobile while all the other code(Controllers) is exactly the same as the normal Template. To me this is a much needed feature. I am not a very good designer and often the need arises to create a Mobile Optimized one or two page App to use in my iOS Apps&amp;#8217; Web Views. This makes things fast for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i1.asp.net/common/www-css/i/mvc4/image004.png&quot; class=&quot;centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final Words&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience with MVC4 is going great. I am developging an OAuth based Web App just to master it and I will share my experience once I am done. All I can say for now is that MVC4 makes me feel like a happy developer. There are a lot of other neat features like Recipe&amp;#8217;s which allow you to generate template based code(Custom or 3rd Party), Browser Overriding, View Switching etc. etc. IF you want to read up a full list of features then please check out the &lt;a href=&quot;www.asp.net/whitepapers/mvc4-release-notes&quot;&gt;Release Notes&lt;/a&gt; . This is all from me for now. Rock on!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Customer Service that makes you Smile</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Its been an year since i Switched from Wordpress to jekyll. I registered this domain name while I was using wordpress by using the wordpress upgrades and paid $10 for it. After switching to jekyll I pointed the aliirz.com to name servers at Linode. Two days ago I got an email from Wordpress Customer services that my domain registration is about to expire and I need renew it. As soon as I saw the email I signed into my wordpress dashboard to make the payment. To my surprise I got the following error message when I tried to make the payment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;alert-box error&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This credit card was issued from an unsupported country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this make me a little angry and disappointed. So I emailed back the customer service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am trying to upgrade my domain manually and I am getting the following &lt;br /&gt;
error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This credit card was issued from an unsupported country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is quite disappointing as I used the same card to purchase and map &lt;br /&gt;
my domain on WordPress an year ago. Can you please help?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was expecting a reply that would say something like &amp;#8220;I am sorry we no longer accept credit cards from your country as per our new policy. Happy Wordpressing&amp;#8221;. If it had been this kind a reply I would&amp;#8217;ve gone all nuclear on wordpress but to my surprise instead this is that they replied back with today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi Ali,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the delay in getting back to you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is known issue, our credit card processor recently changed the counties that they accept cards from.  We are currently investigation alternatives, but in the mean time I have added a full year to the domain registration and domain mapping for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is anything else I can help with just let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray&lt;br /&gt;
WordPress.com | Automattic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Folks! Thats the kind of customer service that makes you smile. I love you wordpress! :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>To Windows Phone or Not</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Many of you do not know that my first smartphone was a Windows Mobile 6.5 based &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gsmarena.com/i_mate_jasjam-1589.php&quot;&gt;i-Mate JasJam&lt;/a&gt; . I loved that phone it was all one geek could ask for at that time, it had &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt;, Google Maps, a powerful browser, a Qwerty keyboard and a stylus(trust me stylus&amp;#8217; were cool  back then) I got this phone as a gift from my brother. Boy, Was I happy with it. After an year of usage the whole shashka(awesomeness) of the phone started to die, possibly because Microsoft stopped focusing on their Mobile OS side. So I sold the phone to a friend and bought an N900.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/n900.png&quot; class=&quot;centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Now the &lt;acronym title=&quot;I still own it btw&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;N900&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/acronym&gt; is different. It is actually the coolest phone I&amp;#8217;ve ever come across. Why? Because its a pure hacker&amp;#8217;s device. Based on a Linux Distribution called Maemo, it totally packs a punch. It has a terminal, you can sudo like any other Linux Distro and best of all its a completely &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maemo.org&quot;&gt;community&lt;/a&gt; driven effort. I am not selling this device, I have decided to keep it for as long as it functions. Nokia does not manufacture or support this device anymore, but the powerful user-driven community does and I am proud to be a part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mango.png&quot; class=&quot;centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
But I am looking forward to get something else to use as a secondary phone and you might&amp;#8217;ve guessed it. Yes, the new windows phone based devices are among my list. I am a bit confused in what to get, but this post is about the Windows Phone and why it attracts me today. So lets bring in the reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Metro UI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new metro UI is awe-inspiring and to be honest I am bored by looking at the same UI of iOS and Android phones. So the UI is a welcome change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Live Tiles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best features are the live tiles, they are like widgets but only better. They work in real-time and show you live information such as messages, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; location, Email etc. The new UI makes everything very accessible from the Home screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Integrated Social Layer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iOS 5 came with an integrated Twitter Layer for apps to utilize. Windows Phone 7.5 does the same, only it does it better. It has a complete social network layer and the people app. This brings your contacts and your social networks at one place. Your contacts&amp;#8217; social network profiles are automatically synced with other information you have about them on your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Not a Battery Muncher&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this is way to good. All current phones running WP7 are not battery munchers like other smartphones. WP7 has a battery-saver function that saves up juice for when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Office Mobile&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With office mobile WP7 gives you the complete MS Office experience on your phone, now no other smartphone out there gives you this facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Linked Inboxes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more people have to struggle between multiple inboxes. You can link them into one so that they become easily manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So these are some of the reasons I am considering a Windows Phone. I would really appreciate if you could help me decide. Do leave me a comment. Rock n Roll!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Hello Accelerometer</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The question new devs ask me the most is &amp;#8220;How do we use the iPhone accelerometer?&amp;#8221;, so I have decided to write a post about how to get data from the iOS device&amp;#8217;s accelerometer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accelerometer is a sensitive piece of hardware that can detect the changing position of the device, from translation motion to rotation; it has the capability to detect the changes using a 3D coordinate system. Using the accelerometer devs can enhance the UX of their apps considerably, similarly game developers can make their games more engaging with it. In this blog post I am gonna show you how to get the accelerometer coordinate values and display them inside a label. So lets get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First lets create a simple UI in the interface builder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/accell-ui.png&quot; class=&quot;centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s that a simple and clean UI. Now lets get to some action, lets write some code. First we create some IBOutlet properties in out interface file for our labels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;#import &amp;lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ViewController&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;UIViewController&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nonatomic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;strong&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;IBOutlet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UILabel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;xLabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nonatomic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;strong&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;IBOutlet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UILabel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;yLabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nonatomic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;strong&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;IBOutlet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UILabel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;zLabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are not done with the interface file yet, we need to implement the UIAccelerometer delegate and create a property to access its values. So after adding these our interface would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;#import &amp;lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ViewController&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;UIViewController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UIAccelerometerDelegate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nonatomic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;strong&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;IBOutlet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UILabel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;xLabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nonatomic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;strong&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;IBOutlet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UILabel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;yLabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nonatomic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;strong&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;IBOutlet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UILabel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;zLabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nonatomic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;strong&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UIAccelerometer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;accelerometer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So all that takes care of the interface. Now we need to setup the accelerometer object so it can actually be of use. We now move to the implementation file of our project and modify the viewDidLoad method as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;viewDidLoad&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;viewDidLoad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
	
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;accelerometer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UIAccelerometer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sharedAccelerometer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;accelerometer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;updateInterval&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;accelerometer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;delegate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Important thing to note here is how we have initialized the accelerometer object, one should never initialize a new instance of this object as its a shared resource. This is the correct way to initialize it. The other two statements are how we setup the update interval of the accelerometer and tell it whose going to be its delegate(in this case its our viewcontroller).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are almost done with this example, the final piece of the puzzle is UIAccelerometer&amp;#8217;s delegate method didAccelerate. We implement that this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;accelerometer:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UIAccelerometer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;accelerometer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;didAccelerate:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UIAcceleration&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;acceleration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;xLabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;NSString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stringWithFormat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;@&amp;quot;%f&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;acceleration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;yLabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;NSString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stringWithFormat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;@&amp;quot;%f&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;acceleration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;zLabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;NSString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stringWithFormat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;@&amp;quot;%f&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;acceleration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trust me thats basically all you need to read data from the accelerometer. Our project is complete.

				<title>Free CDN - Put your static resources in the cloud</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I noticed that &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; and Javascript files in my website were creating a massive overhead. I did a little research about hosting content on &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CDN&lt;/span&gt; to improve page load times and ultimately made my own free little &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CDN&lt;/span&gt; using &lt;a href=&quot;https://appengine.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google AppEngine&lt;/a&gt; under an hour. So all my &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt;, Image and Javascript files are now loaded from the cloud hence the website loads faster than ever. Diagramatically it all looks something like this(click for larger size):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://aliirzdotcom.appspot.com/images/free-cdn.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://aliirzdotcom.appspot.com/images/free-cdn.png&quot; class=&quot;centreThis img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDN&amp;#8217;s are not something new but I was surprised to see that there are not many tutorials to make one if the need arises, so I am sharing my experience and steps to create a free &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CDN&lt;/span&gt; with Google&amp;#8217;s AppEngine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing&amp;#8217;s first, you need to download and install Google App Engine&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SDK&lt;/span&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; I am using a Linux based system so I downloaded the python &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SDK&lt;/span&gt; for Linux. It did not require any installation I just extracted the contents into a Folder inside my Home Folder. Make sure you have python installed on your system, the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SDK&lt;/span&gt; requires python in order to function(You can use Java or Go SDKs if you wish). Then  I added the google app engine folder in my path so that I could easily access the commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;bash&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;export &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$PATH&lt;/span&gt;:/home/ali/appEngine/google_appengine/ 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that done now it was time to upload my files to the cloud server. I created a new application from my Google AppEngine Dashboard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://aliirzdotcom.appspot.com/images/appengine-apps.png&quot; class=&quot;left&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then i created a new folder on my system having the same name as my application and copied my css, javascript and image folders inside it. Now the main piece of the puzzle is the app.yaml file without it the AppEngine will never identify your application as it contains all the necessary stuff. So I created an app.yaml file inside the root of the folder. My app.yaml(do mind the indentation) looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;application: aliirzdotcom
version: 1
runtime: python
api_version: 1
handlers:
- url: /images
  static_dir: images
- url: /css
  static_dir: css
- url: /js
  static_dir: js
- url: /fonts
  static_dir: fonts
 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically its telling appengine the following things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The name of the application.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The version of the application&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Application runtime i.e Python&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The AppEngine &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; version&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Url handlers to the folders i.e mapping urls to specific folders that contain the resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the app.yaml file is in place then its time to launch. Since I added the appengine &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SDK&lt;/span&gt; to my path I can access the commands and files of the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SDK&lt;/span&gt; without having to type long and awkward paths in the Terminal. So with all my static content in place and the app.yaml as well, I type the following command to upload the app to AppEngine in the cloud:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;bash&quot;&gt; appcfg.py update apps/aliirzdotcom/ _
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If ran the first time it will ask your email and password to access the AppEngine. It will deploy all your files and give you a success message. The output might look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;	Checking &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if &lt;/span&gt;deployment succeeded.
	Deployment successful.
	Checking &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if &lt;/span&gt;updated app version is serving.
	Will check again in 1 seconds.
	Checking &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if &lt;/span&gt;updated app version is serving.
	Completed update of app: aliirzdotcom, version: 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you wish to debug before you deploy you can use the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;dev_appserver.py apps/aliirzdotcom/ 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boom! your resources are now in the cloud and can be accessed via the url of the appenengine app in my case it is aliirzdotcom.appspot.com. So all thats left to do is to load your resources from the url. I replaced all the script sources, css and image references to be loaded from the url and whoala! Instant Content Delivery Network in the cloud, making the website faster than ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Hello Core Animation</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://aliirzdotcom.appspot.com/images/core-animation.png&quot; class=&quot;centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I was working on an App for a client, careful planning, proper branding, good color schemes it all was there. What was &lt;br /&gt;
missing was a little bit of jazz(As our Head of Operations pointed out). So instantly I jumped on the bandwagon to add a splash animation at the app&amp;#8217;s start. Have worked with Core Animation had been a long time for me, but I remembered the basics so I decided to make a Hello Core Animation post which might be helpful for someone somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am going to do here is explain the different blocks of Core Animation and how can one add a bit of jazz to a the app&amp;#8217;s screen when its launched for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First step, begin writing the animation block in the AppDelegate&amp;#8217;s applicationDidFinishLaunching method or if your animation is a view controller specific add it to the viewDidLoad method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UIView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beginAnimations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;	&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//Begin animations &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever follows after this statement is considerd to be a core animation action. Be it a size transition of a label, color change of a button or a shiny graphic/image you want to fly in from the right of the screen etc. you add it after this statement. In this example however we would be doing something very simple, we would just make the view that is being loaded flip from right. So the next thing we do is add a tranisition duration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UIView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;setAnimationDuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then we add the transition style:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UIView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;setAnimationTransition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UIViewAnimationTransitionFlipFromRight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;forView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;navigationController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;view&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;YES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will make the view that is being pushed on the navigation controller to flip from right like a page instead of the the standard transition. Finally to make it work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UIView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;commitAnimations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;	&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//Commit animations do the dance. &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will as the name suggests commit the animations. So whatever you have between these two lines of code will get executed as an animation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Blog Redesign...Welcome to the Grid</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://aliirzdotcom.appspot.com/images/yeti.png&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Phew!!! Finally I am happy with the redesign. Yes, aliirz.com has been going through a major redesign phase from the past few weeks and now finally its complete(I think so). So (clears throat) lets talk about what&amp;#8217;s new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website now uses the &lt;a href=&quot;http://foundation.zurb.com&quot;&gt;Foundation Framework&lt;/a&gt; which has become my most favourite prototyping &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; framework since Startup Weekend Lahore. The most used and favourite feature of mine is the grid(not the one from Tron) as it allows creating a flexible, fully customizable layout in seconds. So bascially you can prototype anything be it a website for the web or mobile devices, foundation has all you need to go in uber prototyping mode. Also foundation has built-in support for creating responsive designs(Something I still need to hook up here).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other things I have changed are a new header and footer section utilizing the power of Jekyll includes so I have more control over the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;. You can see the main page has two columns now so that content is more properly arranged. I have a new &lt;a href=&quot;/Folio&quot;&gt;Folio&lt;/a&gt; section which only lists a handful of my projects at the moment. The post headings have now got a CSS3 transition property to their background. The site background is now white to improve readability and now users can subscribe to &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; Feeds as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do leave your comments and feedback on how things look and what can be improved. I am re-learning the web and I am loving it. Cheers :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>HTML and CSS Attributes in MVC3</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;For those of you who use or are learning asp.Net MVC3 might know that it introduces some very useful &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; helpers with its razor view engine. Sometimes the need is to customize the rendered out &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; a little bit more with &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; attributes. So this small post shows how to do that. Imagine you are using a textbox &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; helper in your razor view to render a textbox but you want to use a custom &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; class as well as a placeholder to it so that it looks very very pretty. In order to do just that you need to declare your textbox &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; helper like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;@HTML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Textbox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Searchbox&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;@class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;prettyTextbox&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;@placeholder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;This is placeholder Text&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which will render out a textbox like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; placeholder=&quot;This is placeholder Text&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly you can use other &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; attributes inside your helpers to render out the kind of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; you want. You have full control over the rendered out &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Startup Weekend Lahore</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://aliirzdotcom.appspot.com/images/startup-weekend.png&quot; class=&quot;centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have never seen so many entrepreneurs under one roof ever in my life. I always wanted to to go to one of them techcrunch&amp;#8217;s disrupts to meet with others like me and network. I never imagined I would get the chance to attend an even more awesome event in my own country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a last minute decision to attend this amazing event in Lahore. What I hadthought to be a simple participation turned into an energy-filled, nerve wrenching hackathon 54-hours straight. I will be very honest I had never thought of writing so much code in a day and that too in a simple text editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launching a startup was not the only reason we attended the event. The other reason was networking and getting the chance to meet big names from the Industry in Pakistan. All those seniors became mentors and helped each and every participant build the best project. I too became acquaninted to very inspirtation people like Afaque Ahmed from Breezecom, Raza Saeed from Confez Solutions and Saj Khan from Scrybe. Not only that but I found good friends as well like Junaid Atique, Kamil Waheed and Jaiser Abbas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://startupweekend.org/&quot;&gt;startup weekend&lt;/a&gt; coming up near where you live, I totally recommend checking it out. You will not be sorry!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a very energetic event and it opened a whole new world for me. I am so looking forward to take over the world piece-by-piece ;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Push Local Git Branch To Remote Repo</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This post is for those who are new to the Git System. I am going to show how to create a new branch of a git repo, push it to remote repo and finally check it out on another machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing, create a new branch based on an existing branch with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;git checkout - b &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;New-Branch&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above command creates and switches to the newly created branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then this is how you push it to the remote repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;git push origin New-Branch 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;All set, the newly created branch has been pushed to the remote repository. Now how will we access it on another System? Thats easy too, the first thing that needs to be done on the other system is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;git fetch origin 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will update the repo with the changes from remote repo. But wait this will not add the newly created branch yet, note that it has been fetched but is not being tracked yet. To do that we use the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;git checkout --track origin/New-Branch 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, thats it. Hope this post will help someone. Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Most Amazing Timelapse of the Universe ever</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I came across this beautiful timelapse video on vimeo. It has deeply inspired me. The way the original creator of the video has captured our universe is very unique. The way you can see the whole galaxy move is so soothing that its easy for the watcher to get deeply immersed in the experience. Boy, I am gonna buy a telescope for star gazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;centreThis&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All credit goes to the original creator of this video. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Timehop - Time travel made easy</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://aliirzdotcom.appspot.com/images/timehop.PNG&quot; class=&quot;centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timehop.com&quot;&gt;Timehop&lt;/a&gt; a week ago. The idea behind it was so simple and sounded way too fun that i signed up instantly, who would not want to be reminded of the past(except for the embarrasing moments)? Basically it sends you an email of all your social network(s) activity for the same date of the last year. So its like a time machine that reminds you what were you upto last year the very same day. It does not spam you(Thank God), one email a day is not overkill. As a matter of fact I find myself waiting for my morning&amp;#8217;s dose of Time Travel back to my facebook and twitter feeds from an year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its a great idea and I would really like to see it grow into Mobile Apps and a manual timeline browser someday. Still reading? go Timehop a little, jog your memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Checkbox Control for iOS</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;If you are an iOS developer then you do know that iOS doest not have a checbox control. Yes, you can can use the UISwitch to work out for you but still, we all know how cool checkboxes can be. So here is a little Gist of code to help you implement your own UICheckbox Control. You can use it in your Custom TableView Cells even:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;UICheckBox&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;UIButton&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;addTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;checkBoxClicked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;forControlEvents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UIControlEventTouchUpInside&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;IBAction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;checkBoxClicked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;checked&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;NO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;checked&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;YES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;setImage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UIImage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;imageNamed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;@&amp;quot;checkbox_ticked.png&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;forState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UIControlStateNormal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;checked&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;NO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;setImage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UIImage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;imageNamed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;@&amp;quot;checkbox_not_ticked.png&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;forState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UIControlStateNormal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;dealloc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dealloc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

				<title>EXC_BAD_ACCESS Error...</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Getting that nasty EXC_BAD_ACCESS Exception and your app crashes? and let me guess you cannot detect the cause behind it? Fear not my ninja developer buddies. This exception occurs when a message is being sent to a deallocated or released object. To find the little culprit all we need is a little NSZombieEnabled Environment Variable. It keeps a copy of the deallocated object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this work you need to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In Xcode go to Project&amp;gt;Edit Active Executible &lt;Your Project Name&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Select Arguments.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Now add a Environment Variable called NSZombieEnabled as shown in the screenshot.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Now run your project and analyse it in the Console.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should now see whats causing the problem(you can check the stack trace if needed). Once you have discovered and fixed it make sure you uncheck this Environment Variable. So there you have i,t a very simple yet Ninja Level tip for making sure your app does not crash due to EXC_BAD_ACCESS Exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope it proves helpful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Jekyll</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;There was a time when my blog used to run on Wordpress. I love Wordpress, its plugins, its themes and the overall simplicity but my problem is I am like a rolling stone I never settle for one thing, I keep on moving to better and better, no matter how complex things become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a geek has taught me one thing, do not do what everybody else does. So following this thought i learned about Jekyll from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.destroytoday.com&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Johnny Hallman&amp;#8217;s Blog&lt;/a&gt;. Instantly I knew I had to give this a try. With my new found love for Rails applications, this surely has proven to be a delight. So I am moving my blog from Wordpress &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; to plain &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; with the help of Jekyll. The thing is that any framework or tool that gives you complete control over your rendered &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; is super awesome in my opinion, which is another reason I love working with Asp.net mvc3 and Rails but with Jekyll my blog becomes &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; hence saving me a lot of time and effort, no complex logic involved. Give &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; a try, trust me you will not regret it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Fully Linoded</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Today I moved this blog to a personal &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;VPS&lt;/span&gt; at linode. I feel a significant performance increase. I have grown very fond of linode, it was I must say it was fun to configure a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LAMP&lt;/span&gt; stack, and then moving my blog here from wordpress.com. While I was at it I also installed the Rails framework(which I haven&amp;#8217;t tested yet). &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linode.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;centreThis&quot; title=&quot;linode&quot; src=&quot;http://www.linode.com/images/linode_logo_gray.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;288&quot; height=&quot;65&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The overall experience has been very knowledgeable. I thought it will be a pain to set everything up but thanks to the extensive documentation and an amazing community it turned out to be a piece of cake. Also its &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;VPS&lt;/span&gt; so does not occupy space meaning cleaner greener environment. I would write more but I am too tired. I am happy and feel like a newly turned vegan so I am gonna leave you with a video I happen to like. Cheers&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>HTML5 and CSS3-getting on with it</title>
				<description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;html 5&quot; src=&quot;http://www.w3.org/html/logo/downloads/HTML5_Logo_512.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;473&quot; height=&quot;473&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is changing and so is the Web. With &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; 5 a lot of new elements have been added to the Markup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series of posts are here to help us get to know what changes does &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; 5 bring to the game and how do we use and benefit from it. So lets get on with it. For part 1 of this series I am going to focus on the Semantic Tags which are absolutely basic parts of the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; Document and explain the differences &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; 5 has brought to them:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The DocType Tag&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, its that strange piece of text on the top of a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; Document and Developers like me have never been able to memorize it. We just copy paste it. This is what it looks like:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;lt;!&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DOCTYPE&lt;/span&gt; html &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PUBLIC&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8220;-//W3C//&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DTD&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; 4.01 Transitional//EN&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd&amp;#8221;&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now that&amp;#8217;s hard to remember i know, so html 5 has made it easy for us:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;lt;!&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DOCTYPE&lt;/span&gt; html&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Header Tag&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, its a new tag in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; 5. The specification describes it as &amp;#8220;A group of introductory or navigational aid&amp;#8221;. Normally this is how we used to create a header section:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;lt;div id=&amp;#8220;header&amp;#8221;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;This is a header/h1&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; 5 has made this even simple, by introducing a header tag:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;h1This is the new header&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/header&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Nav Tag&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Another new addition is a nav tag. This tag is described as &amp;#8220;A section of the page that links to other pages on the site or to other sections of that particular page&amp;#8221;. Now we all remember how we used to create a bunch of navigational links inside an unordered list:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;lt;div id=&amp;#8220;navigation&amp;#8221;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Home&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;About/li&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Work&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Shop&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Contact&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; 5 introduces a nav tag to make this job more easier and html markup more readable:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;lt;nav&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Home&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;About/li&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Work&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Shop&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Contact&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/nav&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Section Tag&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Just like the newly added nav and header tags, the section tag is used to divide the content into sections. It is described as &amp;#8220;A grouping of content based around a theme&amp;#8221;. Now sections are equivalent to what we would make from a div to represent different sections of our website for example:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;lt;div id=&amp;#8220;acc-news&amp;#8221;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ACC&lt;/span&gt; Basketball&lt;br /&gt;
News&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;UNC&lt;/span&gt; Beats Duke in&lt;br /&gt;
Champsionship Game!&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Blue Devils are routed&lt;br /&gt;
by the Tarheels at Cameron&lt;br /&gt;
Indoor Stadium.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; 5 gives us a new tag to more conveniently organize the above markup:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;lt;section&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ACC&lt;/span&gt; Basketball News&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/header&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;UNC&lt;/span&gt; Beats Duke in Championship Game!&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Blue Devils are routed by the Tarheels&lt;br /&gt;
at Cameron Indoor Stadium.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Article Tag&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Article tag can be used to divide the contents of a section in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; 5. It is defined as &amp;#8220;An independent, self-contained composition&amp;#8221;. For example the markup in the previous heading can be re-written as:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;lt;section&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ACC&lt;/span&gt; Basketball&lt;br /&gt;
News&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/header&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;UNC&lt;/span&gt; Beats Duke In&lt;br /&gt;
Championship Game!&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/header&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Blue Devils are&lt;br /&gt;
routed by the Tarheels at&lt;br /&gt;
Cameron Indoor&lt;br /&gt;
Stadium.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/article&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now there are some interesting things to note here. See how the header tag is inside a section. Yes, this means you can add as many header tags inside your markup as you like. As you can see we have the news inside an article. This gives you a rough idea about how the article tags are used.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Aside Tag&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The aside tag is described as &amp;#8220;Content related to an article but not critical to its understanding&amp;#8221;. The content inside the aside tag could be just some meta-data, some text thats not really important enough, example:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;UNC&lt;/span&gt; Beats Duke In&lt;br /&gt;
Championship Game&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/header&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Blue Devils are routed by&lt;br /&gt;
the Tarheels at Cameron Indoor&lt;br /&gt;
Stadium.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;aside&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Former Duke Players Cry at&lt;br /&gt;
Game’s End&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/aside&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/article&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Footer Tag&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Just like the header tag, the footer tag is used at the end of a section. Its a special tag for what we would normally create from a div at the bottom of our web page. It is described as &amp;#8220;Includes information that closes out a particular section.&amp;#8221; We used to make a footer this way:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;lt;div id=&amp;#8220;footer&amp;#8221;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Talk to Me Goose&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;copy; 2011 Maverick &amp;amp;&lt;br /&gt;
Goose Ventures.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And now with &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; 5:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Talk to Me Goose&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;copy; 2011 Maverick &amp;amp;&lt;br /&gt;
Goose Ventures.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/footer&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You see, how easy and fun &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; 5 is. Offcourse there are some compatibility issues(same old story) I will be back with more posts on that, we will look at the canvas tag and finally some CSS3. Until then take care y&amp;#8217;all I hope this post is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>La Studio Coke...Rocking the world</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.cokestudio.com.pk/Images/general/large/004.jpg&quot; class=&quot;centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Its not everyday you come across good projects promoting Pakistan in the world. Its no longer the era in which Junoon or the Vital Signs made Pakland famous all over the world, new blood has taken over and they are really rocking. We got Mauj a free-spirited fiery young band, the amazing Shafqat Amanat Ali whose voice works magic, Zeb and Haniya the talented duo,  the ever amazing Rahat Fateh Ali khan who has been tutored by the great Maestro of vocals himself and many more&amp;#8230;all of them represent Pakistan with their respective genres of music. every now and then some event or a project surfaces that brings these great artists  together on one platform&amp;#8230; &lt;br /&gt;
One such project i really respect and salute is Coke Studio. A platform that truly shows harmony of our nation and the talent of our Artists. the brainchild of Rohail Hayat brings together multiple artists to perform live in groups or individually. Coke Studio like no other sets  a standard in music. with great artitst including Atif Aslam, Ali Azmat, Strings, Shafqat Amanat Ali, Saieen Zahoor just to name a few. this project promotes peace and harmony by combining the music of  artists of all genres be it folk, classical, pop or rock. it truly creates a space of peaceful, memorable bits of life once you listen to the music. With 5 episodes done till now Coke studio has a bright future ahead, and surely this platform is really necessary to show the real true-spirited Pakistanis we are. we love our culture and we know how to blend in. here is a short description from the studio&amp;#8217;s site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coke Studio embodies a musical fusion of exciting elements and diverse influences, ranging from traditional eastern, modern western and regionally inspired music. Bringing alive the magic of live recordings and performances, Coke Studio prides itself on providing a musical platform which bridges barriers, celebrates diversity, encourages unity and instils a sense of Pakistani pride. Coke Studio is an inspired step by Coca-Cola for having created a platform where renowned as well as upcoming and less mainstream musicians from various genres can collaborate musically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impressed? give it a try. i guarantee you will enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>As the wind blows...</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://aliirzdotcom.appspot.com/images/abu-grave.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive alignCentre&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I sit near your final resting place. trying to remember everything you said, you did, your smiles, the way you were…even your last days…i look upon my life and the way it connected with you. i remember the time you used to come back from work and the way i used to hug you, the way you took me in your arms when i was a little boy. the way you used to tell me right and wrong, the things i learnt from your wisdom. the way you always appeared a king to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss everything about you…not a single moment of my life is spent without me thinking about you…feeling the physical hole left in my life never filling up…just like the hole in my heart…i wish i was stronger in emotions like you…i wish i was a better son too…i really miss you…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in the silence, all of a sudden a cool breeze touches me…I feel it filled with your love and affection, it feels like a gentle touch on my shoulders…whispering to me that all is not lost and i get to see that you still live in me dad, you left your soul in us…you might not have a physical existence around me dad but i know you are there watching, listening and smiling&amp;#8230;i am proud to be your son…&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dedicated to my father &lt;strong&gt;Shabir Ahmed Raza&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>NXT Rotation Sensor Program</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;My buddies are  working on Lego Mindstorms &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NXT&lt;/span&gt; this year. with a tougher floor plan than last time and an even tougher goal, I decided to help them out with a small program that proved to be very useful to me last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignCentre img-responsive&quot; title=&quot;Degree Measurer&quot; src=&quot;http://dejavu87.wordpress.com/files/2009/07/measure.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;NXT&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This program actually measures the rotations of a motor. all the user has to do is hold the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NXT&lt;/span&gt; in one hand and a motor connected to it in the other. Running the motor by hand on the floor plan shows the degrees of rotation on the NXT&amp;#8217;s Screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here it is guys. May this help you with all the NERC&amp;#8217;s. and may we Win this year. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;
