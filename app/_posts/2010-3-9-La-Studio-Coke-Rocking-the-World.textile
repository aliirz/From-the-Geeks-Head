Its not everyday you come across good projects promoting Pakistan in the world. Its no longer the era in which Junoon or the Vital Signs made Pakland famous all over the world, new blood has taken over and they are really rocking. We got Mauj a free-spirited fiery young band, the amazing Shafqat Amanat Ali whose voice works magic, Zeb and Haniya the talented duo,  the ever amazing Rahat Fateh Ali khan who has been tutored by the great Maestro of vocals himself and many more...all of them represent Pakistan with their respective genres of music. every now and then some event or a project surfaces that brings these great artists  together on one platform... 
One such project i really respect and salute is Coke Studio. A platform that truly shows harmony of our nation and the talent of our Artists. the brainchild of Rohail Hayat brings together multiple artists to perform live in groups or individually. Coke Studio like no other sets  a standard in music. with great artitst including Atif Aslam, Ali Azmat, Strings, Shafqat Amanat Ali, Saieen Zahoor just to name a few. this project promotes peace and harmony by combining the music of  artists of all genres be it folk, classical, pop or rock. it truly creates a space of peaceful, memorable bits of life once you listen to the music. With 5 episodes done till now Coke studio has a bright future ahead, and surely this platform is really necessary to show the real true-spirited Pakistanis we are. we love our culture and we know how to blend in. here is a short description from the studio's site:

Coke Studio embodies a musical fusion of exciting elements and diverse influences, ranging from traditional eastern, modern western and regionally inspired music. Bringing alive the magic of live recordings and performances, Coke Studio prides itself on providing a musical platform which bridges barriers, celebrates diversity, encourages unity and instils a sense of Pakistani pride. Coke Studio is an inspired step by Coca-Cola for having created a platform where renowned as well as upcoming and less mainstream musicians from various genres can collaborate musically.
